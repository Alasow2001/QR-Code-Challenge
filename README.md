### Built with

### What I learned

I had learned how to utilise various CSS concepts such as:
  - Box Model
  - Flexbox
  - Media Queries

```css
  @media screen and (max-width: 375px){

  }

  :root{
    --slate500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --slate300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --white: hsl(0,0%,100%);
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_root.php) - This helped me to set up variables that I reused throughout the CSS file, to stop me from repeating code.
